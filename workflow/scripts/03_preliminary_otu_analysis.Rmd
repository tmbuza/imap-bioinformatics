# Preliminary OTU analysis using `Mothur`
The preliminary analysis (`alpha_beta_diversity rule`) is part of the bioinformatics analysis. It includes:

- Creating reads count for each group.
- Subsampling for downstream analysis.
- Rarefaction.
- Computing Alpha diversity metrics.
- Computing Beta diversity metrics.
- Getting sample distances.
- Constructing sample phylip tree.
- Generating ordination matrices including PCoA and NMDS.
