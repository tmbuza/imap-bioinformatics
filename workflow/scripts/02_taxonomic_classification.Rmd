# Mothur classification methods
There are four methods that can be used to profile microbial communities present in a sample. Here we briefly decribe each method:

## 1.Classify OTUs
- OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)) are clusters of similar sequences and are commonly accepted as analytical units in microbial profiling when using 16S rRNA gene markers.

## 2. Classify Phylotypes
- A phylotype in microbiome research is a DNA sequence or group of sequences sharing more than an arbitrarily chosen level of similarity of a 16S rRNA gene marker.

## 3. Classify ASVs
- ASVs Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs)in microbiome research is any inferred single DNA sequences recovered from a bioinformatics analysis of 16S rRNA marker genes.
- ASV is typically really a cluster of sequences that are one or two bases apart from each other.

## 4. Classify Phylogenies
- Microbial phylogenies are from gene sequence homologies.  Models of mutation determine the most-likely evolutionary histories.
