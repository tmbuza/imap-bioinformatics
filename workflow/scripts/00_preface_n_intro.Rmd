# Microbial Profiling Using Mothur

##  Tentative snakemake workflow
- Typically the snakemake workflow is defined by specifying rules.
- The rule-graph graphically shows the input-output files. 
- The snakemake is capable of automatically determining the dependencies between the rules and creates a dot-like DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph).

```{bash ruledag, include=FALSE}
bash workflow/scripts/rules_dag.sh
```
